# 🛠️ DuctTapeDB

DuctTapeDB is a lightweight, SQLite-powered solution designed for **quickly persisting and searching Pydantic models**. Whether you're working on **non-technical projects** or building **fast prototypes with FastAPI**, DuctTapeDB provides a simple and intuitive way to store and manage your data.

Originally created for a hobby project, DuctTapeDB has evolved into a powerful tool for **rapid development**, with a focus on ease of use and integration. 🚀

---

## **Why Use DuctTapeDB?**

- **Pydantic-Centric**: Effortlessly store and search Pydantic models without additional setup.
- **FastAPI-Ready**: Perfect for creating CRUD APIs in minutes.
- **Lightweight**: Powered by SQLite—works out-of-the-box, no server required.
- **Async and Sync Support**:
  - **HookLoopDB** (Async): Feature-rich and optimized for modern async workflows.
  - **DuctTapeDB** (Sync): A straightforward synchronous option, with plans to align features across both modes.
- **Dataloss Safety and Optimism**:
  - **SafetyTapeDB** (Async):
    - **Optimistic Locking**: Automatically version updates.
    - **Soft Deletes**: Built-in support for marking records as deleted without losing data.
    - **Automatic Timestamps**: Tracks `created_at` and `updated_at` for all records.
- **Persist on change conveniences**:
  - **AutoSafetyTapeDB** (Async):
    - **asetattr**: Save the model to the db as you update an attribute
---

## **Features**

- **Simple Persistence**: Automatically save and retrieve Pydantic models with minimal code.
- **Advanced Querying**: Query data using JSON fields and SQL expressions.
- **Soft Deletes**: Mark records as deleted while keeping them recoverable.
- **Restore Functionality**: Easily restore soft-deleted records by ID.
- **Automatic Timestamps**: Tracks record creation and updates with `created_at` and `updated_at`.
- **Async and Sync Options**: Use what fits your project best.
- **FastAPI Integration**: Quickly build APIs with CRUD functionality.
- **SQLite-Powered**: Works anywhere—no need for additional infrastructure.

## **Installation**

Install DuctTapeDB using pip:

```bash
pip install ducttapedb
```

For examples using **FastAPI** and **FastUI**, ensure you also install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install fastapi fastui pydantic
```

---

## **Quickstart**

### 1. Define Your Pydantic Model

```python
from ducttapedb import SafetyTapeModel

class Item(SafetyTapeModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    price: float
    in_stock: bool
```

---

### 2. Create a Database

```python
from ducttapedb import SafetyTapeTable

# Create an async SQLite database
async def setup_database():
    table = await SafetyTapeTable.create_file("items", "items.db")
    await table.initialize()
    Item.set_table(table)
```

---

### 3. Perform CRUD Operations

#### Create
```python
item = Item(name="Widget", description="A useful widget", price=19.99, in_stock=True)
await item.save()
```

#### Read
```python
retrieved_item = await Item.from_id(item.id)
print(retrieved_item)
```

#### Query
```python
items_in_stock = await Item.models_from_db(order_by="json_extract(data, '$.price') ASC")
print(items_in_stock)
```

#### Soft Delete and Restore
```python
await item.soft_delete()
await item.restore()
# or restore by id
await Item.restore_from_id(item.id)
```

#### Delete
```python
await item.delete()
```

## **Using with FastAPI**

You can quickly spin up a CRUD API using DuctTapeDB with FastAPI. Here's how:

1. **Run the Example API**:
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install fastapi fastui pydantic
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     fastapi dev examples\api\main.py
     ```

2. **Navigate to**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) for the interactive API documentation, or to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) for a very simple FastUI table and a form to insert items.

## **More Examples**

Other examples included in this repo:

1. **Inserts with a timer going**:
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     python examples\async_inserts\example.py 
     ```
    - You should see stats printed as it inserts and retrieves rows with the async HookLoopModel

2. **Query and Order by JSON Fields**:
   - Query records where a JSON field matches a value:
     ```python
     items_with_high_priority = await Item.models_from_db(
         filter_sql="json_extract(data, '$.priority') = ?",
         filter_params=["high"]
     )
     ```
   - Order records by a JSON field:
     ```python
     items_ordered_by_price = await Item.models_from_db(
         order_by="json_extract(data, '$.price') DESC"
     )
     ```

3. **Save as You Go**:
   - 
    ```python
    from ducttapedb import SafetyTapeTable, AutoSafetyTapeModel

    # Create the model
    class Item(AutoSafetyTapeModel):
      name: str
      price: float
      in_stock: bool

    # Create an async SQLite database
    table = await SafetyTapeTable.create_file("items", "items.db")
    await table.initialize()
    Item.set_table(table)

    new_item = Item(name="Shoe", price = 19.99, in_stock=True)
    # This will update the db and change the price and version
    await new_item.asetattr(key="price", value=15.99) # on sale!

    # This will also update the db, only on fields that we've changed
    new_item.in_stock = False # oh no!
    await new_item.save()
    ```

4. **More examples planned**
---

## **Roadmap**

- Align features across **HookLoopDB** (Async) and **DuctTapeDB** (Sync).
- Add more advanced querying capabilities.
- Simplify relationships and data normalization.
- Add more convenience features.
